LiRE Install Server
-------------------

This little piece of software makes building and installing full LiRE
systems more user-friendly. Normally, you need to be root at the end
of the LiRE building process. If you run this install server on the
build system every user can walk through the LiRE build and install
completely.

Installation:
------------
On systems using upstart, the lire-install-server.conf can
be put into /etc/init in order to automatically start
the server at boot.

The install_server.py lire_base_socket_class.py and
lire_core_install (part of the LiRE-git repo) must be
put in /usr/local/bin/.
